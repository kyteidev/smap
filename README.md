> [!WARNING]
> I don't have an Apple Developer account yet. You may encounter a dialog that says Apple cannot verify this app or something similar. Click **Okay**, then go to **System Settings** > **Privacy and Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**.
>
> If you get a "This app is damaged and cannot be opened" dialog, run
> ```xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app``` to bypass this dialog. This may appear because I don't have a developer account.
